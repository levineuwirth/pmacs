# Active work — cross-machine resume ledger

**Snapshot: 2026-07-24.** This file records volatile work that has not
landed on `main`. Read it after `docs/agent-handoff.md`. Remove completed
entries when their PR merges; do not let this become a second permanent
backlog.

## Repository authority

- Canonical development URL:
  `https://github.com/levineuwirth/pmacs.git`. This ledger uses the
  normalized local alias `githubsucks` so its refs and recovery commands
  are identical on every machine. Remote names are otherwise
  machine-local: `origin` may name this canonical URL, a release mirror,
  or something else, and therefore has no authority by name alone.
- Canonical base at this snapshot:
  `githubsucks/main` @ `b168dca` (folding Stage 2 landed-doc refresh #150
  atop folding Stage 2 #149, the ledger refresh #147, web grammars HTML+CSS
  #146, and the LaTeX Stage 1 #144 / inline-math framing #145 pair; protocol
  v19).
- On the transfer source, `origin/main` named a release mirror at
  `d3fa632` and lagged badly. On the current destination, `origin` names
  the canonical URL. This difference is why all recovery begins by
  verifying URLs and normalizing `githubsucks` rather than trusting
  `origin/main`.
- The shared desktop checkout contained unrelated uncommitted work. The
  branches below were prepared in isolated worktrees; never clean or
  overwrite the shared checkout to recover them.

Start on another machine by inspecting its remotes:

```sh
git remote -v
git remote get-url githubsucks
```

If the second command says the alias is absent, add it; if it prints a
different URL, stop and resolve that collision rather than overwriting an
unknown remote:

```sh
git remote add githubsucks https://github.com/levineuwirth/pmacs.git
```

Then recover current refs:

```sh
git fetch githubsucks --prune
git log -1 --oneline githubsucks/main
git worktree list
git status --short --branch
```

The `git log` command must expose `b168dca` or a newer intentional main.
If it does not, stop and repair the remote/fetch configuration.

## Active lane: GPU initial target

- Portable implementation branch: `githubsucks/gpu-initial-target` @
  `be8c67c` (second-review fixes plus complete verification); worktree
  `../pmacs-gpu-initial-target`.
- Approved framing branch: `githubsucks/gpu-initial-target-framing`;
  Revision 2 checkpoint `71039d1`.
- Original implementation base: canonical `githubsucks/main` @ `c49a8c7`
  (folding Stage 1 #142); current canonical `main` @ `b168dca` is integrated
  before publication of the second-review merge. Protocol was v19 before this
  work.
- State: implementation checkpoint `2dd30ec`; first review-fix checkpoint
  `bef1c08`; second-review checkpoint `be8c67c`. Current `main` is integrated,
  smoke-tested, and fully gated at protocol v20; merge publication is next.
  PR #148 remains open for user review:
  `https://github.com/levineuwirth/pmacs/pull/148`.
- Scope delivered: one session-scoped `pmacs --gpu [--socket …] FILE` target,
  protocol-v20 semantic bootstrap, launcher-owned tilde/cwd resolution, exact
  Unix path transport, pre-window target readiness, replica coherence, and the
  approved behavioral acceptance matrix.
- Post-integration verification: formatting and strict Clippy; 1,815 default +
  1,992 CRDT library tests; target and invocation gates 14 CRDT each; Folding
  Stage 2 48 CRDT; M4 121; required GPU 152; Vterm Stage 3 5 default + 7 CRDT;
  isolated-config workspace sweep 3,334 across 88 suites. The prior two-window
  Wayland/Vulkan isolation smoke remains valid; this round changes only daemon
  failure/publication behavior.
- Deferred unchanged: automatic GUI selection, multiple files, general
  live-open commands, packaging, and remote GPU paths.

Recovery worktree after the first push:

```sh
git worktree add --track \
  -b gpu-initial-target \
  ../pmacs-gpu-initial-target \
  githubsucks/gpu-initial-target
```

## Folding lane (Arc 6) — Stages 1 and 2 MERGED; Stage 3 (GPU) is next

Both shipped stages are on `main`; nothing in this arc is in flight. Stage 3
has **no branch and no framing yet**.

- Stage 1 (headless fold engine) merged as **#142**, Stage 2 (grid/daemon
  collapse) as **#149** — both under "Closed since the last snapshot".
- Retained, carrying nothing unmerged: branches `folding` / `folding-tui`
  and worktrees `../pmacs-folding` / `../pmacs-folding-tui`. The framings
  `docs/folding-framing.md` (rev 5) and `docs/folding-stage2-framing.md`
  (rev 4) are the approved artifacts Stage 3 re-scouts against.
- **Stage 3 (GPU) obligations, already named by the framings** — the
  starting point for its own framing doc: GPU collapse at TUI parity;
  caret/hit-test fold-awareness; the `BufferSnapshot` **fold-mirror clear**
  (parent R2-4 — without it, empty-after-revert diff suppression leaves
  stale folds on the GPU, the same trap class as #120); CRDT-origin and
  GPU-optimistic interactive unfold (parent R2-3); and flipping
  `FrontendView.fold_projection` to `true` for semantic frontends, which
  Stage 2 deliberately left `false` (Q#FD21).

## Parked lane: kill-ring browser + persistence

- Portable branch: `githubsucks/kill-ring-browser`
- Parked framing head: `503c489`
- State: framing only, revision 2; no implementation and no PR.
- Status: explicitly parked by the user on 2026-07-20.
- Its original scout was based on `0efb5cd`. The preserved framing marks
  this ground truth stale and requires a complete re-scout against the
  then-current `githubsucks/main` before implementation.
- Compile-mode has merged since the original scout, so old
  “compile-mode in flight” keybinding/touch-set assumptions are not
  authoritative.

Recovery worktree, only when the user un-parks it:

```sh
git worktree add --track \
  -b kill-ring-browser \
  ../pmacs-kill-ring-browser \
  githubsucks/kill-ring-browser
```

## Documentation lane

- Portable branch: `githubsucks/handoff-2026-07-20`
- Carries synchronized `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, this ledger, the
  durable handoff refresh, and the keybinding reference correction.
- It changes no runtime code.
- Review and merge this documentation branch separately; it must not be
  folded into a feature framing branch.
- Now also absorbs both landed arcs: Vterm Stage 1 (#126) and the config
  registry (#127). Canonical `main` is merged into it up to `2e37c04`,
  so its diff against `main` is documentation only.

## Closed since the last snapshot

- **Folding Stage 2 (grid/daemon collapse) — MERGED as #149** (`main` @
  `6ed4fe9`, 2026-07-24, after **five** review rounds). The grid TUI now
  renders collapses. Spine (Q#FD12): `src/fold_view.rs`'s `VisibleLineMap`,
  derived from the fold store plus a window's line offsets and **never
  stored**, threaded as `Option<&'a VisibleLineMap>` on a lifetime-bearing
  `Viewport<'a>` that stays `Copy`. No wire schema or protocol change; the
  GPU path is Stage 3. 48 acceptance tests on the real `paint_frame` grid,
  every behavioral claim bite-verified. Durable design points, each a trap
  Stage 3 inherits:
  - the map's unit is a **merged hidden component** (overlapping *or
    adjacent* intervals unioned, keeping the earliest visible head), not a
    fold — folds may cross, and a later fold's own head can be hidden;
  - instances are **per rendered window** and **per command/event
    operation**, never per frame; a command's map follows the operation's
    **target** window, since a wheel event names a pane without activating it;
  - fold projection is **per-frontend** (`FrontendView.fold_projection`) —
    shared `EditorCore` motion would otherwise make a simultaneous unfolded
    GPU session's cursor skip lines it still displays;
  - a hidden cursor normalizes by **position**, not row, and `set_view_top`
    clamps in the setter rather than being repaired at render time;
  - the interactive-Lua unfold keys on the **post-intercept** edit site — a
    managed buffer intercept may legally relocate the op.

  Process notes worth keeping: `main` moved under the arc, and the merge was
  textually clean but **not semantically clean** (#146 added `Viewport`
  literals the new `folds` field invalidated) — a clean `git merge-tree` does
  not mean the merged tree compiles. CI was red at review on the macOS/luajit
  `outline_5_level_100_entry_renders_within_100ms` budget flake and went
  green on rerun.

- **Documentation ledger refresh — MERGED as #147** (`main` @ `0a479ae`,
  2026-07-24). The #142 housekeeping, expanded after review found the ledger
  stale through four merges rather than one. Its own macOS/luajit red was the
  vterm `VTERM_ALT_READY` PTY timeout; green on rerun.

- **Web grammars HTML + CSS — MERGED as #146** (`main` @ `47581f4`,
  2026-07-23). `.html/.htm/.xhtml` and `.css` highlight off the official
  `tree-sitter-html` 0.23 / `tree-sitter-css` 0.25 crate query constants (no
  in-repo overlay), and HTML's `INJECTIONS_QUERY` lights up `<script>` → js
  and `<style>` → css. Durable lesson recorded in
  `docs/web-grammars-html-css-framing.md`: the `highlight.rs` capture table
  is **global**, so adding a capture name retro-paints every other language —
  check the reverse direction and pin it.

- **LaTeX Stage 1 — MERGED as #144**, with its parent inline-math framing
  committed as **#145** (`main` @ `f09b0a1`, 2026-07-23).
  `.tex/.latex/.sty/.cls` highlight via `codebook-tree-sitter-latex` 0.6 plus
  the first in-repo query overlay (`builtin/queries/latex/highlights.scm`,
  `include_str!`) — the reusable pattern for grammars whose crate ships no
  usable queries. The crates.io `tree-sitter-latex` is provably broken (no
  `scanner.c`). The math parser and Tiers 3–4 are deferred to the inline-math
  arc.

- **Folding Stage 1 (headless fold engine) — MERGED as #142** (`main` @
  `c49a8c7`, 2026-07-23, after three review rounds; round 3 clean). The
  instance-side fold store + translating/dropping `View`, the structural
  source (derived head line, closer-aware tail), the Lua data API +
  interactive `C-c @` commands, the command-path pre-edit unfold, and
  authoritative-empty `FoldState` production landed with no protocol bump.
  The `folding` branch and worktree (`../pmacs-folding`) are retained but
  carry nothing unmerged; the `folding-framing.md` framing is preserved.
  CI red at merge was an unrelated environmental perf flake
  (`outline_5_level_100_entry_renders_within_100ms`, macOS/luajit only),
  green on rerun. Stage 2 has since merged as **#149** (above); durable
  substrate seams live in `docs/agent-handoff.md` §1.

- **Vterm Stage 3 (protocol v19 + GPU terminal) — MERGED as #135** (`main`
  @ `cac4961`, 2026-07-22, after two review rounds). Arc 5's terminal stage
  is complete (compile mode #113, Stage 1 #126, Stage 2 #130, Stage 3 #135).
  Its lane, worktree (`../pmacs-vterm-gpu`), and branch are done; durable
  substrate facts live in `docs/agent-handoff.md` and `docs/vterm-framing.md`.

- **Branches deleted 2026-07-22 (authorized):** `vterm-stage3-framing`
  (Revision 8 framing; its content is carried on `vterm-gpu`, verified as a
  superset before deletion — the branch was NOT an ancestor of `vterm-gpu`
  because the framing was copied rather than merged, so it needed a forced
  local delete) and `tab-width-parity` (a clean ancestor of `main` via
  #137). Both removed as worktree + local ref + `githubsucks` ref; the
  `origin` tracking refs were pruned. The `-framing` branches for each are
  deliberately kept.

- **Tab-width rendering parity — MERGED as #137** (`main` @ `2625ec7`,
  2026-07-22). One fixed 8-column `TAB_STOP_COLUMNS` in `pmacs-protocol`
  now drives core/TUI columns, GPU code projection, and minimap width;
  source bytes and protocol ranges are unchanged. Its lane, worktree, and
  `tab-width-parity` branch (local + `githubsucks`) are deleted; the
  `tab-width-parity-framing` branch is kept. This closes the long-standing
  "tab width is a rendering-parity
  bug, NOT a config gap" deferral recorded in `docs/agent-handoff.md` §5.
- **Locals-query processing — MERGED as #134** (with handoff #136), and
  **modeline detection handoff #133**. Both landed between this lane's
  base and its canonical-main integration.

- **Config registry — MERGED as #127** (`main` @ `2e37c04`). Its lane
  (`config-registry`, worktree `../pmacs-config-registry`) is done; the
  branch is kept but carries nothing unmerged. Durable substrate facts
  moved to `docs/agent-handoff.md` §1 per rule 3 below.
- Both this and Vterm Stage 1 ran as **concurrent lanes in sibling
  worktrees off `main`**, with the shared files (`src/editor.rs`,
  `src/lua_bindings/mod.rs`, `src/lib.rs`) assigned to one lane each in
  advance. The rebase of the second lane onto the first had **zero
  conflicts** — worth repeating for future parallel work, along with its
  precondition: agree the file split before either lane starts, and keep
  each lane's footprint in the other's files to a single line.

## Update protocol

Whenever a listed lane changes materially:

1. update its public branch and head/state here;
2. record new verification and remove superseded caveats;
3. keep durable architecture in `docs/agent-handoff.md`, not here;
4. remove the lane after merge or abandonment;
5. verify every recovery command from a clean worktree before calling
   the transfer complete.
