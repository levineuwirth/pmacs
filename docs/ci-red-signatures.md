# CI red signatures — the triage registry

**This file is the authority for judging a red run whose failure might
be a product defect.** A row records what was seen, what is known about
why, and what would retire it. A row is not a claim that the failure is
harmless, and it is deliberately not called a flake.

Everything that was once here and is not a possible product defect has
been closed, with the date and the mechanism that closed it, in the
table at the end. New intermittent reds do not get rows here. They are
filed as GitHub issues with the `intermittent-red` template (selector,
job, required fragments, log link), one issue per mechanism, with later
occurrences as comments on the issue. The first three filed that way
are #248 (a compile-mode wait ending before the finalization pass),
#250 (`ETXTBSY` on a freshly written stub) and #251 (a bundled package
failing to load during a parallel library test run).

## How a row matches

A test-name match is never sufficient. A red matches a row only when
the exact test selector matches, the job or flavor matches, and every
required fragment is present in the failure output. Where a fragment
lists alternatives (`ESRCH` / `No such process`), any one satisfies it.
Fragments are normalized, never pasted verbatim: pids, elapsed times
and rendered OS-error suffixes vary between runs. A failure in a listed
test that does not carry that row's fragments is a new incident, judged
on its own; two rows can share a test and differ in one fragment.

## The rerun rule

A green rerun after a red establishes non-reproduction and nothing
more: not environmental cause, not harmlessness, not retirement. The
same signature on the rerun is a second occurrence, not a coincidence,
and it stays blocking pending a merge-base control, which is what
distinguishes "this branch caused it" from "this tree has it". A
different signature is a new incident. Retirement is causal: a row
closes when its mechanism is removed or explained, never by a count of
green runs. A red matching a closed row and postdating its closure
reopens the question; one predating it corroborates the row.

## Live rows

### R3 — live-leader EPERM with an unobservable group

| field | value |
|---|---|
| selector | `--lib process::tests::a_successful_signal_disposition_depends_on_whether_it_is_fatal` |
| job | macOS / lua54 |
| required fragments | `EPERM` and `measured_group=unobservable(` and (`ESRCH` / `No such process`) and `leader=live` |
| occurrences | one, PR #214 run 30932558752 attempt 1 |
| candidate mechanism | a group-directed `kill` returned EPERM while the leader was observed live, and `measured_group`, the one field able to disagree, could not be read. Unresolved; possible product defect |
| retirement | diagnosis and disposition by whoever next touches process signalling or the reap ledger. Never a green rerun |

Same test as the retired R2 (`leader=exited(signal SIGUSR1)`, a test
race fixed by a readiness gate and an `exec`); only the fragment
separates them. R2's fixture change touched no product code, so a change
in how often this row appears is evidence about frequency, not cause.

### R5 — an async pump deadline in the supersede close path

**Reopened 2026-09-08 as NEVER CLOSED.** Not as a recurrence: the
closure was void when it was written. R5 was closed 2026-09-05 with
"readiness waits migrated to `tests/common/ready.rs`, which reports
elapsed and last-observed state; a recurrence is an issue". This row's
failing site is `pump_async`, a private helper in `src/editor.rs`'s own
`#[cfg(test)]` module. `tests/common/ready.rs` is compiled into the
integration targets and an in-crate unit test cannot use it, so that
migration never reached this site and could not have. The row was never
retired by anything; it was only stopped being looked at. The one thing
the closure asserted that was true is that a wait should report what it
waited on, which is now done here by hand.

| field | value |
|---|---|
| selector | `--lib editor::tests::stream_supersede_delivers_cancelled_to_on_close` |
| job | GitHub Actions, macOS / lua54 |
| required fragments | `async pump deadline exceeded` |
| occurrences | two: `main`, run 30555667095, 2026-07-30; and PR #257 at `e78d184`, run 34222042303, job `Test (macos-latest / lua54)` (102047236847), `src/editor.rs:12842`, `test result: FAILED. 2196 passed; 1 failed; 11 ignored`. The panic line moves with `editor.rs` and is not part of the signature |
| candidate mechanism | the test drives a superseded stream to its `on_close` and pumps `tick_async` until the Lua marker appears, under a fixed 2-second deadline the helper sets itself. Whether two seconds is short for a loaded macOS runner or the close notification is genuinely lost is not known, and the first occurrence's log no longer says anything either way. Unresolved; possible product defect |
| retirement | diagnosis. The deadline now reports its subject, its elapsed time and its poll count, so the next occurrence says whether it missed by a millisecond or by two seconds --- that is a step toward the diagnosis and is not itself a closer. Never a green rerun |

**The lesson the void closure carries.** A closer that names a mechanism
has to be checked against the failing site, not against the row's
description. R6 and U8 were closed on the same migration in the same
sitting; both of those do fail inside integration targets, so the
migration does reach them, and U8's 2026-09-08 recurrence carried
fragments precisely because it had. R5 was swept along with them on a
resemblance.

### R7 — managed-retry attach hits a broken pipe under sweep load

| field | value |
|---|---|
| selector | `-p pmacs-gpu attach::tests::managed_retry_survives_transients_and_uses_the_successful_stream` |
| job | local (Linux), inside a workspace sweep; never seen in isolation or in CI |
| required fragments | `transient sequence must attach` + `Handshake(Io(` + `BrokenPipe` (or `code: 32`) |
| occurrences | at least sixteen, 2026-08-07 to 2026-09-07, all local, all under sweep load; the panic line moves with `attach.rs` and is not part of the signature. The thirteenth and fourteenth: gate logs `20260905T202734Z-1751532` (step `07-sweep`, load average 14.2) and `20260905T205642Z-2051072` (step `05-sweep` of the six-stage gate). The fifteenth and sixteenth: gate logs `20260907T170429Z-45241` and `20260907T185321Z-604527`, both in step `06-sweep-luajit`, the LuaJIT-only sweep `--protocol` adds, each ending `test result: FAILED. 325 passed; 1 failed` on `-p pmacs-gpu --bin pmacs-gpu`. All four at `attach.rs:1889` with all three fragments. The count is a floor: nobody has counted runs, so an occurrence is only ever recorded when someone reads the log |
| candidate mechanism | the test drives a scripted transient-then-success sequence over a real socket pair; unknown whether the broken pipe is the fixture's writer closing early or a retry-path defect. Unresolved |
| retirement | hardening that removes the named mechanism plus a discriminating witness, or a diagnosis showing the fixture, not the code, closes the pipe |

What the occurrences establish: the tree is excluded twice over (two
consecutive gate runs on one worktree differing by one markdown file,
green then red; several occurrences on documentation-only commits), and
green reruns number in the dozens; both sweep flavors of the `--protocol`
plan have produced it, so the Lua flavor is not the discriminator either. What they do not establish: a
mechanism, or a rate, since nobody has counted runs and failures over a
fixed window. The remaining candidates have to be varied inside a gate
run, one per run.

### U16 — a git invocation finds its working directory deleted

| field | value |
|---|---|
| selector | any `--lib packages::fetcher::tests::*` that runs `git`. First seen as `cache_survives_across_fetcher_instances` alone; widened 2026-09-08 when five of them failed together in one sweep with these fragments, which is what the candidate mechanism predicts --- the doomed working directory is process-global, so every concurrent `git` child in that module is exposed, not one named test |
| job | local (Linux), the workspace sweep |
| required fragments | `Unable to read current working directory: No such file or directory` + `remote did not send all necessary objects` |
| occurrences | six: three on 2026-08-31 within eleven hours, the third on `main` after a documentation-only merge; three more on 2026-09-08 in local sweeps within an hour (gate logs `20260908T101700Z-2279879` and `20260908T105335Z-2697918`, one selector each, and `20260908T110408Z-2820743`, FIVE together --- `cache_survives_across_fetcher_instances`, `fetch_after_upstream_tag_removed_surfaces_at_resolve`, `fetch_clones_into_cache`, `fetch_twice_does_not_reclone_via_sentinel`, `resolve_branch_returns_branch_head` --- all carrying both fragments), on a branch touching neither `packages` nor `file_io`. Several intervening sweeps of the same tree were green, so the rate on this machine is neither zero nor one |
| candidate mechanism | `bare_filename_saves_in_cwd` (`src/file_io.rs`) calls `set_current_dir` on a `TempDir`; concurrently this test's `run_git` spawns `git` with no explicit cwd, so the child inherits the temp directory; the parent restores its cwd, which does nothing for the child; the `TempDir` drops under a live `git`. A candidate with a citation, not a demonstrated chain |
| retirement | run the two selectors concurrently in a tight loop until it reproduces, or remove the process-global mutation (`save_atomic` taking the directory, or that test in a subprocess). A serial guard around `set_current_dir` does not close it: the child outlives the guard |

### U17 — a supersede race lost the other way, on `main`

| field | value |
|---|---|
| selector | `--test m8_1_acceptance read_dir_supersede_cancels_in_flight_predecessor` |
| job | GitHub Actions, the serialized crdt sweep (`--test-threads=1`) |
| required fragments | `first read_dir must be superseded; got ok` |
| occurrences | three: `main` at `aae5b35`, run 33375945966 (the serialized crdt sweep); `main` at `d97e137`, run 34205653191, job `Test (macos-latest / luajit)`; and PR #257 at `8f6784f`, run 34220035122, job `Test (ubuntu-latest / luajit)`. The last two run at cargo's DEFAULT parallelism under D23, and the third is on LINUX, so neither serialization nor macOS is required to produce it. The second is the merge-base control for the third: the same signature is on `d97e137` itself, so the branch did not introduce it. That control is ONE run at the base, which is one sample: it establishes that the signature exists on `d97e137`, not its rate. PR #257's second run, 34222042303 at the head `e78d184`, is GREEN on `Test (ubuntu-latest / luajit)`, which is non-reproduction and nothing more |
| candidate mechanism | the predecessor completed before the cancellation took effect. `--test-threads=1` was the first occurrence's candidate: it serializes the test functions in one executable and so removes one source of contention the test's "in flight" depends on. The second occurrence has no such flag, which does not refute the mechanism --- a fast predecessor is a fast predecessor however the runner got there --- but it does mean serialization is not required to produce it, and the remaining common factor is a macOS or Linux CI runner rather than a scheduling flag. Nothing has measured the predecessor's duration under either, and nothing rules out a real supersede defect |
| retirement | diagnosis; a witness that holds the predecessor in flight deterministically rather than by load |

## Closed rows

Each row's full evidence is in this file's history before 2026-09-05.
One line per row: what it was, when it closed, and what closed it.

| row | what it was | closed | closer |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | `supersede_cancels_in_flight_job_within_50ms` missed its 50 ms budget | 2026-09-05 | the assertion is a wall-clock budget; it is `#[ignore]` and runs in the perf jobs and `scripts/gate --perf` |
| R2 | `SIGUSR1` delivered before the trap was installed | 2026-08-05 | test race fixed with a readiness gate and an `exec` |
| R4 | readiness predicate satisfied by an empty file | 2026-08-05 | `wait_for_file` waits for the expected bytes, with three witness tests |
| R5 | `async pump deadline exceeded` in the supersede close path, macOS | 2026-09-05, **VOID** | the closure named the `tests/common/ready.rs` migration, which cannot reach an in-crate unit test and so never applied to the failing site. R5 is live again above, as never-closed |
| R6 | readiness file never published in the panel terminal fixture, macOS | 2026-09-05 | same migration; the wait now reports what the child last wrote |
| R8 | LSP listview row rendered relative to a stray ancestor marker | 2026-08-08 | test hermeticity fixed |
| A1, A2 | historical claims with no linked occurrence | 2026-09-05 | nothing was ever measured; a recurrence is an issue |
| U1 | an unclassifiable local red, fragments not captured | 2026-09-05 | unclassifiable; a recurrence is an issue |
| U2 | `m6_1_pty_raw_mode_disables_kernel_echo`, `stty -a` output empty | 2026-09-05 | readiness migration; the PTY read now waits for the record it asserts on |
| U3 | the R7 selector with fragments lost | 2026-09-05 | folded into R7's occurrence count |
| U4 | `a_pty_resize_blanks_the_host_before_repainting`, macOS, three occurrences | 2026-09-05 | not reproduced since 2026-08-15; a recurrence is an issue. A related Linux observation postdates the closure: #255, and the note below |
| U5 | `ctrl_c_during_reconnect_sleep_yields_clean_exit`, macOS lua54 | 2026-09-05 | one occurrence, not reproduced; a recurrence is an issue |
| U6 | `criterion_1` and `composition_overhead` red together | 2026-09-05 | both are wall-clock budgets, now `#[ignore]` |
| U7 | a different render-budget test red each sweep (dired, outline) | 2026-09-05 | render budgets, now `#[ignore]` |
| U8 | `acc28_child_input…`, macOS luajit, fragments destroyed | 2026-09-05 | readiness migration (the R6 family); a recurrence is an issue. It recurred 2026-09-08 on macOS lua54, with fragments this time because of the migration: #259, and again in the next run on the same platform (34222042303, job 102047236847), which is a comment on #259 |
| U9 | a PTY test and a budget test red together in one sweep | 2026-09-05 | the budget half is `#[ignore]`; the PTY half is U2's mechanism |
| U10 | the budget red rotating between two runs of one commit | 2026-09-05 | budgets `#[ignore]` |
| U11 | `dispatch_parse_round_trips_a_rust_source_file` missed its parse budget, macOS | 2026-09-05 | the round trip stays in the default run; the 100 ms budget is a separate `#[ignore]` test |
| U12 | a budget test and a PTY test together in `lib-crdt` | 2026-09-05 | budgets `#[ignore]`; the gate no longer has a `lib-crdt` stage |
| U13 | `skipped_directories_are_reported_with_a_reason` received empty child stdout inside the sweep | 2026-09-05 | the gate runs each test once, in one sweep; a recurrence is an issue |
| U14 | four selectors red in one gate run across three stages | 2026-09-05 | three are budgets, now `#[ignore]`; the fourth (`state: initializing`) is a readiness wait, migrated |
| U15 | a rotated multi-red cluster with a load reading | 2026-09-05 | all budgets, now `#[ignore]` |
| U18 | a Go checksum-database fetch failed before anything was built | 2026-09-05 | not a test; filed as issue #249 |
| U19 | a terminal bell not observed within a 5 s poll | 2026-09-05 | readiness migration; the wait reports the last frame seen |
| U20 | `composition_overhead` red alone | 2026-09-05 | a budget, now `#[ignore]` |
| U21 | `m6_1_pty_canonical_mode_keeps_kernel_echo` red alone in `lib` | 2026-09-05 | U2's mechanism; the gate runs each test once |

### U4's question is open again, on Linux

A failure carrying U4's selector and all three of its fragments was
observed on 2026-09-07 on Linux, in the default-feature sweep of
`scripts/gate --protocol` at `3abc153` (gate log
`20260907T195626Z-978397`, step `05-sweep`; 33,566 bytes emitted after
the first painted frame with no CSI 2 J among them). It postdates U4's
closure and so reopens the question, and it is filed as #255.

It is not a recurrence of the row. A row matches only when the job
matches as well as the selector and the fragments, and U4's job is
macOS; its own exemption of the Lua flavor as a matching key covers
lua54 against luajit, not macOS against Linux, so nothing in the row
establishes that one platform's observation is the other's. The
mechanism is unconfirmed. U4's record also holds a deliberate
reintroduction of the genuine resync defect reproducing these same
fragments, so the symptom cannot discriminate a fixture race from a
product regression, and the discrimination in #255 is what would settle
it.

### PR #257 ran CI twice, and the second run is the one on its head

Two runs exist and every C1 record described only the first, by name and
as "the first run":

- run **34220035122** at `8f6784f`, `pull_request`, **12 green, 3 red**;
- run **34222042303** at `e78d184`, the pushed head, created
  2026-09-08T11:41:44Z — eight seconds after the head commit — completed
  12:01:39Z, conclusion **failure**: **13 green, 2 red**. `Docs
  consistency` is skipped in both, correctly: the PR's changed paths
  include code.

The trees the two ran differ by one markdown file. Three things are in
the second run.

`Test (macos-latest / lua54)`, job 102047236847, failed twice.

1. `acc28_child_input_and_the_c_c_escape_work_unchanged_in_a_panel`,
   `tests/bottom_panel_stage1_acceptance.rs:2447`, `bytes in
   /var/folders/.../T/.tmph8ib1k/ready did not become ready within 5s
   (waited 5.031151625s, 54 polls); last observed: No such file or
   directory (os error 2)`, `test result: FAILED. 49 passed; 1 failed`.
   Selector, job and all three required fragments are #259's: a **second
   occurrence**, twenty minutes after the issue was opened. It is a
   comment on #259, which is what that issue's own first line requires.
2. `editor::tests::stream_supersede_delivers_cancelled_to_on_close`,
   `src/editor.rs:12842`, `async pump deadline exceeded`, `test result:
   FAILED. 2196 passed; 1 failed; 11 ignored`. The message, the path and
   the platform are closed row **R5**'s, and this postdates its closure,
   so it reopens R5's question. R5 is live again above, as never-closed.

`Test (macos-latest / luajit)`, job 102047236931, failed once:
`v15_peer_never_receives_theme_facts_and_v16_does`,
`tests/theme_faces_acceptance.rs:1383`, `read Hello: Io(Os { code: 35,
kind: WouldBlock, message: "Resource temporarily unavailable" })`, `test
result: FAILED. 26 passed; 1 failed`. Under this file's matching rule
that is **not** #258. #258's selector is
`a16_26_real_daemon_v17_gate_v18_first_frame_and_late_join` in
`statusline_segments_acceptance`; a test-name match is never sufficient
and here even the test name differs. It is a new incident that shares
#258's failing expression — a fixture-set short read timeout on the
daemon's server-first `Hello`, here 250 ms set four lines above the
failing call. It is recorded as a comment on #258 with that difference
stated, because folding it in on resemblance is what the matching rule
forbids; whether the two share a mechanism is unestablished. The suite
is one this branch edited (two `set_line_numbers('off')` lines in
`editor()` and `open_and_wait_for_parse`, nowhere near `probe`).

`Test (ubuntu-latest / luajit)` is green in this run, so U17 did not
reproduce at the head. That is non-reproduction and nothing more.

### The macOS reds have a merge-base control, and it points at the branch

`git merge-base e78d184 githubsucks/main` is `d97e137`, whose post-merge
run is **34205653191**. Both of its macOS legs were read from their job
logs (`gh run view --job <id> --log`; the API logs endpoint returns
empty for these):

- `Test (macos-latest / lua54)`, job 101994444426: **zero failures in
  the whole job** — 120 `test result: ok` lines and not one `test
  result: FAILED`. It ran
  `acc28_child_input_and_the_c_c_escape_work_unchanged_in_a_panel ...
  ok`, `v15_peer_never_receives_theme_facts_and_v16_does ... ok` and
  `a16_26_real_daemon_v17_gate_v18_first_frame_and_late_join ... ok`.
- `Test (macos-latest / luajit)`, job 101994444326: exactly one failure
  in the whole job, `read_dir_supersede_cancels_in_flight_predecessor`
  (U17's second occurrence). It ran `acc28... ok`, `a16_26... ok` and
  `v15_peer... ok`.

So all three macOS signatures this branch produced — #259's, #258's and
the `theme_faces` incident's — ran at the merge base and passed there.
**The branch is a candidate for all three rather than excluded from
them**, and the C1 records that reasoned from untouched files are
superseded: the branch changed a default that every window renders
through, so an untouched suite is not an unchanged suite.

**The weight of this control, in the same words as U17's.** It is one
CI run at the merge base, which is one sample. U17's control is one such
run in which the signature *did* appear, which establishes that the
signature exists on `d97e137` and not its rate. This is one such run in
which three signatures did *not* appear, and by the rerun rule above,
applied at the base instead of at the head, that is non-reproduction and
nothing more: a single green run does not establish absence in a
load-dependent test. What the control changes is which way the burden
falls, not how much evidence there is, and it diagnoses nothing.

`e78d184`'s commit message states #258's non-causation flatly — "which
is upstream of everything this branch changes --- the read that failed
precedes the AttachRequest" — without the "an argument from the failing
expression, not a measurement" qualifier that the passes, the PR body
and the four issues all carry. That claim is superseded by the control
above. The commit is pushed and is not rewritten; this is the
correction.
