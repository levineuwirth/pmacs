// syntax.rs --- T M4.1 tree-sitter integration: parse types, the
// per-buffer ParseView, and the worker-side run_parse function.
// T M4.2 layers bundled grammars; T M4.3 adds highlight-query
// loading and the capture-walk that feeds the highlight view.

//! Tree-sitter integration (T M4.1 -- T M4.3).
//!
//! The async runtime ([`crate::async_runtime`]) already carries the
//! dispatch shape Tree-sitter needs (parse-on-worker, supersede,
//! frame-cadence settle). This module adds:
//!
//! * [`ParseRequest`] / [`ParseTreeBundle`] --- the inputs and outputs
//!   that travel between the main thread and a worker.
//! * [`run_parse`] --- the worker-side body. Synchronous; called from
//!   the parse closure submitted by [`crate::async_runtime::AsyncRuntime::dispatch_parse`].
//! * [`ParseView`] / [`ParseViewHandle`] --- the per-buffer
//!   [`crate::view::View`] implementation that mirrors buffer bytes,
//!   captures every [`Edit`] as a [`tree_sitter::InputEdit`] (with
//!   correct row/col [`tree_sitter::Point`]s), and holds the most
//!   recent [`ParseTreeBundle`]. State lives behind an
//!   [`Arc<Mutex<ParseViewInner>>`] so the buffer-owned `Box<dyn View>`
//!   and the Lua-side glue (which needs to read the tree and feed
//!   back installed bundles) share the same backing store.
//! * [`HighlightSpan`] / [`compute_highlight_spans`] --- T M4.3
//!   capture-walk over a settled tree using a bundled
//!   `highlights.scm`. The resulting spans, sorted "wider first",
//!   feed [`crate::highlight::SyntaxHighlightView`]'s render path.
//!
//! M4.2 wires concrete grammars (`tree-sitter-rust`,
//! `tree-sitter-lua`) on top of this module. M4.1 uses
//! `tree-sitter-rust` only as a `dev-dependency` to drive acceptance
//! tests.
